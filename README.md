# Government-Policies-and-the-Propagation-of-COVID-19

The world is still bearded with a global pandemic that is making the work of policymakers very arduous. Limited bystanders imagined the depth and breadth of the breaking point that the world is facing moment, with COVID-19 affecting not only health, but also employment, education, trade, movements and food security â€“ there's hardly any aspect of our social and lucrative system that has not been fettered or halted by the present crunch. In reexamination, the 2007-2008 great financial crisis now seems like a small-scale practice of these dislocations to our socioeconomic system, with around one-quarter of total GDP directly impacted by the present crisis. Governments around the world have mobilized to implement measures to manage the situation and the spread of COVID-19. 
This project will aim at investigating the causal link between government policies and the propagation of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will focus our attention on different measures whether they are  more traditional and incentive measures that go through traditional channels such as public spending but also measures specific to epidemics such as containment measures in order to see the effectiveness and explore indeed the causal relationship between these policies and the situation of the global pandemic from the start of the pandemic in January 2020 to now.
